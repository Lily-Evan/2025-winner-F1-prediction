# Formula 1 Race Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project investigates the application of machine learning techniques to predict Formula 1 race outcomes. By leveraging historical race data, driver performance statistics, constructor capabilities, and contextual race parameters, the goal is to develop predictive models capable of forecasting race positions or performance indicators with high reliability.

---

## Motivation
Formula 1 represents one of the most technologically advanced and data-rich sports globally. Race performance depends on a complex interplay of factors including driver skill, car performance, track characteristics, weather conditions, and strategy execution.

Traditional performance assessment relies on expert knowledge and manual interpretation of metrics. Machine learning provides an opportunity to discover hidden performance patterns and build predictive systems that can support analytics, performance evaluation, and strategic insights.
